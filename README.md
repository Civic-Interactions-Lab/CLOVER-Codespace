## Abstract

The rainfall problem is programming exercise where users input daily rainfall amounts until a sentinel value (e.g., -999) is entered, after which the program calculates and reports the total and average rainfall.

---

## 1. Assignment
write a program that processes an input consisting of daily rainfall measurements (non-negative integers) until it encounters the integer -999. The program should output the average of the numbers. 

**
**Example:**

Enter daily rainfall amounts (enter -999 to stop):

10

20

0

15

-999

Total rainfall = 45.0

Average rainfall = 11.25

## 3. Grading Criteria
30 points – The program can tell if the input is valid.

30 points – The program correctly outputs average.

30 points – The program correctly outputs total.

10 points – The source code is reasonably formatted.
